/**
 * ListHelper is a recursive list outputer that works inside the CrudFields decoration system
 * 
 * This helper will send the field to CrudHelper's output method. It should be called through 
 * /Elements/Navigators/li_link.ctp or an equivalent.
 * 
 * This assumes only one field is in the columns list. Since we loop on columns, if there 
 * are more fields, you'll end up with multiple LIs per record.
 * 
 * The calling code will make an instance of this class, sending values to configure the 
 * filter iterator. Then it will make the parent level filter iterator and call the newly 
 * made instance's outputRecursiveLi() method with that and the result object.
 * 
 * The biggest constraints to flexibility of this class are:
 *		- Locked to UL lists. This could be abstracted in the configuration
 *		- The LI attributes are limited to a hard-wired class setting. 
 *			A handler class could be sent in to do the job
 *		- The filter iterator is limited to doing == comparison
 *			The kind of comparison could be abstracted or possibly a closure could be
 *			 sent to do the comparison? This one probably isn't a real limitation though
